#' Multiserver
#'
#' @description Simulates how customers in line at the bank go through a
#' "first come first serve" queuing system as long as their arrival and service times have already been predetermined.
#' @param Arrivals Number of Customer Arrivals
#' @param ServiceTimes How long a customer's service takes.
#' @param NumServers The number of servers currently working. This will always be
#' an integer.
#'
#' @return Either a table or single tuple containing the arrivals, service start/end time
#' and the number of servers
#' @export

#' @examples Multiserver(Arrivals = bank$arrival_time, ServiceTimes = bank$service_time, 5)

  # ChosenServer = which server the ith customer will use
  # ServiceBegins = when the ith customer's service starts
  # ServiceEnds = when the ith customer's service ends

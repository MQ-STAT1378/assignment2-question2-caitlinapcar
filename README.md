## Multiserver Package

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of this project is to create a package “Multiserver” that can
generate length of time for customers in line at the bank.

The package takes into account “predetermined factors”; the arrival time
and length of the service in conjunction with how many bank tellers are
working to produce a final result of how long a customer would be
waiting in line.

## Attempted Tasks:

-   Correct R package structure
-   Appropriate documentation
-   Implement `testthat`
-   Use `Git` and `GitHub` correctly
-   Implemented `tibble`
-   Added provided dataset with documentation.

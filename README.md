# STAT1378 - Assignment 2, Question 2

## Multiserver Package

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of this project is to create a package “Multiserver” that can
generate length of time for customers in line at the bank.

The package takes into account “predetermined factors”; the arrival time
and length of the service in conjunction with how many bank tellers are
working to produce a final result of how long a customer would be
waiting in line.

## Attempted Tasks:

-   Correct R package structure
-   Appropriate documentation
-   Implement `testthat`
-   Use `Git` and `GitHub` correctly
-   Implemented `tibble`
-   Added provided dataset with documentation.
-   Attempted to create a `Github Pages` site see
    [here](https://mq-stat1378.github.io/assignment2-question2-caitlinapcar/)
    -   I had initially created a page using my “personal” git (i.e the
        one that isn’t connected to this unit) but it wasn’t working and
        somehow I created another one that seemed to be okay but it’s
        not in the list of files within this project if that makes
        sense! 😄

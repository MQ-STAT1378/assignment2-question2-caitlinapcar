# STAT1378 - Assignment 2, Question 2

## Multiserver Package
<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of this project is to create a package "Multiserver" that can generate length of time for customers in line at the bank.

The package takes into account "predetermined factors"; the arrival time and length of the service in conjunction with how many bank tellers are working to produce a final result of how long a customer would be waiting in line. 


## Attempted Tasks:

* Correct R package structure
* Appropriate documentation
* Implement `testthat`
* Use `Git` and `GitHub` correctly
* Implemented `tibble`
* Added provided dataset with documentation.

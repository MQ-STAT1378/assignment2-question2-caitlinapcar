## Multiserver Package
<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of this project is to create a package "Multiserver" that can generate length of time for customers in line at the bank.

The package takes into account "predetermined factors"; the arrival time and length of the service in conjunction with how many bank tellers are working to produce a final result of how long a customer would be waiting in line. 

An example of the type of output the package can produce can be seen below:
```{r}
head(Multiserver(Arrivals = bank$arrival_time, ServiceTimes = bank$service_time, 3))

```
